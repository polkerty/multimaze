puzzle_game1.py is the heart and soul of the program: has all the logic of the levels, level editor, level player, etc
level_organizer.py is responsible for deciding what levels to include in what tab, and makes the json file: possibly some of the syntax is windows specific, so leave it to make
more_levels.py contains all the levels I've made
level_maker.py I run when I want to make a new level (or edit and existing one)
level_play.py is just where I like to play levels that have been made
